#    App lets users predict teams and their scores amongst friends and families.
     A reward is connected to that to whom the prediction is correct.
     Proposed way of earning in our App - Small fee deduction to the predict prize of users.
     Proposed predict prize credit airtime (later money after testing and adhering to legal qualifications)
     Estimated to be daily users on app on a lower side 1 million kenyans.
     -I think we should first do test on telegram.
     Telegram game platform allows html games to share scores and compete in chats.
     We can build a simple html page that allow users to predict the winning team
     of a soccer game.Telegram games are played in chats eg group and personal  chats.Each member of the chat 
     is able to see their fellow members scores and hence they are able to compete and have fun.
     I expect (Joe) to go through telegram game API https://core.telegram.org/bots/games
     and also play some games in telegram and see what talking about.
     -Telegram is widely used here in Kenya and hence a good platform for testing.
     The test will help us know how people will receive and use our app.
     -Estimated days of completion of test page - 3 days.
     -Kindly comment and tell me how you view this.
     App to be in android version.
     IDE - react native
     Targeted users - sports fans (soccer)
     Tested market - current betting environment.
